    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>How to make steakhouse-quality steak at home. Step 1: Buy a great steak from a great butcher. Step 2: Salt it liberally. Step 3: Gradually build up a crusty sear. Step 4: Butter. Butter?! Yep—butter. Browned, nutty butter will deliver toasty flavor to every bite. It’s the secret to pretty much all the great steakhouse dinners you’ve ever had.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1¾"-thick bone-in rib eye (about 1½ lb.)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp. vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 sprigs rosemary</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored doneness (120°–125° for medium-rare), 8–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. (For medium-rare, your steak should reach an internal temperature of 125°–130°.)</li>
            <li>Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1" thick. Spoon some infused brown butter over steak and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
            
        </ol>
